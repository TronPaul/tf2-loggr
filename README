(?) - feature may or may not be possible with current sourcemods.
      Investigation is needed in the feasibility of adding the 
      needed data to existing log mods.

Very few features are completed at this time.  When more are I will 
start marking which are complete and which aren't.

Usage
-----

From this directory run `python tf2loggr [LOGFILE] [OUTFILE]` this
will make a csv formatted stats file at OUTFILE.
